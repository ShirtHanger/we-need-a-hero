Search URL By name

https://www.superheroapi.com/api.php/749a30707cb8e9fdcef7e93c31353b2b/search/${heroName}

OR By ID

https://www.superheroapi.com/api.php/749a30707cb8e9fdcef7e93c31353b2b/${heroID}

ID returns single object. name returns array of objects

Problems with ID Search

    Not user friendly

    (Bright side: Possible "Surprise me!" button! works better with ID search!)

Problems with name search

    Exact spelling or nothing. Don't expect to fix this tbh

    Returns an array of Hero objects.
        Multiple results means multiple heroes in array.
        Can just return the first hero that fits requirement. Fix this later.

        Possible solutions
            multiple display
            If the array's length is more than 1 (Multiple results)
                For loop to pull civilian name of each hero
                Ask "Which one?"
                    When they select, take the civilian name into a variable
                    Check if the name is equal to the drill location for each array item
                    Select that hero

Other stuff:

1. If user inputs "Spider Man" instead of "Spider-Man", do not execute, alert to tell them they forgot the hyphen
2. Display logo of publishing company on side somewhere
3. For mobile design, EVERYTHING will be a column. Figure out how to hide certain elements or just don't include them period.

=============================

Sep 28th basic goals

Turn the long line of setting text content into a function
Turn the setting of background and company logo into a function
This allows you to pass in argument of random hero ID and ID search link instead of manually doing it.

Stats bar toggle: 
    Set visibility or display of power stats, bio stats, and occupation stats class(es) to visible, hidden/none, and hidden/none respectively
    Iterate over list of each class with “For of” loop. Try queryselectorall first
    If the attribute of visibility is hidden…
    set it to visible, then break

    If that’s too much, do similar to your set background. If else block. Manually set attributes for all 3
    Or just reduce stats to 2, instead of 3
    After that, turn into function

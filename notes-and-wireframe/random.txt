ID returns single object. name returns array of objects

Problems with ID Search

    Not user friendly

    (Bright side: Possible "Surprise me!" button! works better with ID search!)

Problems with name search

    Exact spelling or nothing. Don't expect to fix this tbh

    Returns an array of Hero objects.
        Multiple results means multiple heroes in array.
        Can just return the first hero that fits requirement. Fix this later.

        Possible solutions
            multiple display
            If the array's length is more than 1 (Multiple results)
                For loop to pull civilian name of each hero
                Ask "Which one?"
                    When they select, take the civilian name into a variable
                    Check if the name is equal to the drill location for each array item
                    Select that hero

Other stuff:

1. If user inputs "Spider Man" instead of "Spider-Man", do not execute, alert to tell them they forgot the hyphen
2. Display logo of publishing company on side somewhere
3. For mobile design, EVERYTHING will be a column. Figure out how to hide certain elements or just don't include them period.

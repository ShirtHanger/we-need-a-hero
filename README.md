# We Need a Hero!

Personal HTML project. 

My project will allow users to input the name of over 700 characters across Marvel, DC, and even some manga using a fanmade Superhero API
They will be displayed on a trading card-style format, showing off an image, their name, stats, and other tidbits

In addition to that, I plan on adding an updating list of previous pulls at the bottom of the page, clicking them will bring up the same character again

Stretch goals:
* Background changes based on character alignment, publisher,
* "Surprise me!" button, using a random number generator function and API ID search
* Button to toggle stats at bottom of card
